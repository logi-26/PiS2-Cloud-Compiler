# PiS2-Cloud-Compiler
V0.1 by Logi26 25-01-2018.

Python client/server scripts to compile a PS2 elf file on a networked Raspberry Pi.

The Raspberry Pi must have the homebrew PS2 SDK installed:
https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2sdk

Uses Python 2.7.0 since this is the default Python version on the latest Raspian OS (Strectch).

If you make any modifications or improvments to the scripts, please create a pull request to share your changes.

HOW TO USE:

pis2_cc_svr.py should be run on the Raspberry Pi.
pis2_cc_client.py should be run on the system that contains your source code.

The pis2_cc_client.py script requires 2 parameters:
1. The path to the source files directory.
2. The name of the generated elf file. (this should be the name of the elf file generated by your Makefile)
